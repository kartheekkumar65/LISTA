# Pytorch implementation of Learned ISTA

This repo contains the implementation of recurrent neural networks for sparse coding. The recurrent network resulted from the unfolding of Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA). Hence we call this network Learned ISTA (LISTA).

> Requirements - torch, numpy.
